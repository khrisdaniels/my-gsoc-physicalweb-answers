# Queue

Implement a queue with the following operations:
- Enqueue element x into the end of the queue.
- Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
- Print the element at the front of the queue.

Example:

The first element in the input it is the number of commands that will be processed.
Example we have 10 commands: 1 42 → put 42 in the list, 2 → pop the head, etc.

# Running Median

Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. The data set must be ordered in ascending mode:

- When the input size is odd, we take the middle element.
- When the set contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample.
